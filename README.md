# Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and Unsupervised Learning
Here in this repository, I have explored the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. The training and interpretation are performed using a gradient-boosting model with XGBoost. Additionally, KFold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning is implemented. The repository also delves into unsupervised learning.
